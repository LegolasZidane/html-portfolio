<h1>The Best Movies According to Legolas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h3>
<p>
Loved Harry Potter since childhood. This is where Harry encounters the first horcrux.
</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h3>
<p>
Tri Wizard Cup and the return of Voldemort. Period.
</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Animals</h3>
<p>
A very deep movie. Jake makes you feel how he felt through his book but with a completely different scenario. Astonishing at best.
